        <h1>Rhino Software.</h1>
        <p>Rhino Software is focussed on developing software solutions that support the management of rhino populations. With
           20 years of experience in rhino conservation, our developers have designed an ‘RMS’ software package that captures
           all the core data required to keep records, analyse and plan the management of rhinos. In addition to recording
           recognised demographic data, <strong>RMS</strong> will includes features that allow for acquisition of data from other digital
           platforms (e.g. SMART, Epicollect), import and analysis of genetic data, and a number of graphical analyses. We
           pay particular attention to the security requirements for such sensitive data, and to that end, all information in
           our databases is fully encrypted.</p>
        <p>Version 1 of <strong>RMS</strong> is currently in development, and planned for beta testing at the end of March 2022. This
           version will operate as single-seat desktop application for Windows. Version 2 will extend the  deployment
           options to multi-user LAN deployments, and subsequent versions will integrate advanced import and analysis
           options.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in our <strong>RMS</strong> software, and would like to be included in our regular updates,
           please email us on <a href="mailto:info@rhinosoftware.co.za">info@rhinosoftware.co.za</a>.</p>
