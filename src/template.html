            <p>Welcome to</p>
        <h1>RhinoSoftware.co.za</h1>
        <p>We are focussed on developing software solutions that support the management of rhino populations. With
            20 years of experience in rhino conservation, our developers have designed an <strong>‘RMS’</strong> software package that captures
           all the core data required to keep records, analyse and plan the management of rhinos. In addition to recording
           recognised demographic data, <strong>RMS</strong> will includes features that allow for acquisition of data from other digital
           platforms (e.g. SMART, Epicollect), import and analysis of genetic data, and a number of graphical analyses. We
           pay particular attention to the security requirements for such sensitive data, and to that end, all information in
           our databases is fully encrypted.</p>
        <p>Version 1 of <strong>RMS</strong> is currently in development, and planned for beta testing at the end of March 2022. This
           version will operate as single-seat desktop application for Windows. Version 2 will extend the  deployment
           options to multi-user LAN deployments, and subsequent versions will integrate advanced import and analysis
           options.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in our <strong>RMS</strong> software, and would like to be included in our regular updates,
           please email us on <a href="mailto:info@rhinosoftware.co.za">info@rhinosoftware.co.za</a>.</p>
